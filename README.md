# Fraud Detection Using ML and Neural Networks
February 2021

This project focused on the challenging task of fraud detection in financial transactions using machine learning techniques. The data, characterized by significant class imbalance, was addressed using under-sampling, where the majority class (non-fraudulent transactions) was reduced to match the minority class (fraudulent transactions). The dataset, after cleaning and correlation analysis, was modeled using various algorithms including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Key features like online transactions, non-use of PIN numbers, and the absence of certain variables like “Repeat Retailer” were essential in detecting fraudulent activities.

To evaluate the performance of these models, we relied on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score, prioritizing F1-score due to its emphasis on minimizing false negatives. Several machine learning models were compared, and the Random Forest algorithm emerged as the top performer in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1-score, while the second Artificial Neural Network (ANN2) model delivered the best recall. Overall, this project highlighted the importance of model selection, feature engineering, and dealing with imbalanced data for effective fraud detection.
